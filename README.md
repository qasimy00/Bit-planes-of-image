# Bitplanes
1. bitplanes.gif shows what information is stored in each bit plane
2. buildbitplanes.gif is a cumulative representation of the bit planes
3. blur.gif is a blurring effect using simple blur
4. gaussianblur.gif is a blurring effect using gaussian blur

# Notes
- It would be easier to understand the bit planes by using grayscale images first.
- The difference between Gaussianblur and blur shows how gaussian retains more information.
